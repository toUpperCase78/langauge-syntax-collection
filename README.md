# hello-github-2019
That's my first repository after a very long time. Wow! That's more than two years, unbelievable!

Here, I'm now able to write more in this branch and after that, I'm ready to commit this change.
Anyway, I'm planning to create more repositories here, thus all of my projects in recent years will be organized and maintained here.
