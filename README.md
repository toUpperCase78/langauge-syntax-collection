# language-syntax-collection

**My collection of syntax structures of programming languages I've known...**

**The programming languages available here are:** C, C++, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, Javascript

The purpose of this repository is to bring these langauges together and compare their syntaxes against many common subjects. Therefore, my aim is to easily learn the similarities and differences between each other, and uniqueness of features for specific ones when applicable.

First of all, you can find "Hello, World!" output codes in the directory _01 - Hello World_.

More different parts will come at a later date...

## Progress

- [X] "Hello World" output
- [ ] Basic number operations
- [ ] Variable types
- [ ] Type conversions
- [ ] Conditions
- [ ] Switch conditioning
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Scientific operations
- [ ] Read/write files
- [ ] Object-oriented prog.
- [ ] Other lang. specific features

## IDEs I've Used

- **C/C++:** Orwell Dev-C++ with TDM-GCC 4.9 compiler
- **Java:** NetBeans 8.x with Java 8 JDK
- **Python:** Python 3.7 IDLE and Spyder (Anaconda)
- **Go:** Visual Studio Code for source and Go 1.12 for compilation
- **Ruby:** Notepad++
- **Javascript:** Visual Studio Code for source, embedded into HTML page; running in modern web browsers like Google Chrome. Developer tools must be opened to see the output in console.
