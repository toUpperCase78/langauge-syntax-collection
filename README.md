# language-syntax-collection

**My collection of syntax structures of programming languages I've known...**

**The programming languages available here are:** C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, Javascript & bash

![Language Syntax Collection](https://i.ibb.co/Kx8t1SW/language-ten-in-one.png)

The purpose of this repository is to bring these langauges together and compare their syntaxes against many common subjects. Therefore, my aim is to easily learn the similarities and differences between each other, and uniqueness of features for specific ones when applicable.

_This repository project will progress slowly, a time-consuming one; meaning that codes will be available here after some research and making sure that they work with no errors..._

First of all, you can find "Hello, World!" output codes in the directory _01 - Hello World_.

More chapters will be added at a later date...

- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Scientific operations
- [ ] Read/write files
- [ ] Object-oriented prog.
- [ ] Other lang. specific features

## IDEs I've Used To Execute

- **C/C++:** Orwell Dev-C++ with TDM-GCC 4.9 compiler
- **C#:** Visual Studio 2019 Community
- **Java:** NetBeans 8.x with Java 8 JDK
- **Python:** Python 3.7 IDLE and Spyder (Anaconda)
- **Go:** Visual Studio Code for source code and Go 1.12 for compilation
- **R:** RStudio (Anaconda)
- **Ruby:** Notepad++
- **Javascript:** Visual Studio Code for source, embedded into HTML page; running in modern web browsers like Google Chrome. Developer tools must be opened to see the output in console.
- **bash:** nano (while in Terminal) or default text editor, in Linux-based OS with bash shell
