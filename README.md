# language-syntax-collection

**My collection of syntax structures of programming languages I've known...**

**The programming languages available here are:** C, C++, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, HTML & Javascript

The purpose of this repository is to bring these langauges together and compare their syntaxes against many common subjects. Therefore, my aim is to easily learn the similarities and differences between each other, and uniqueness of features for specific ones when applicable.

First of all, you can find "Hello, World!" output codes in the directory _01 - Hello World_.

More different parts will come at a later date...

## Progress

- [X] "Hello World" output
- [ ] Basic number operations
- [ ] Variables and types
- [ ] Conditions
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Scientific operations
- [ ] Read/write files
- [ ] Object-oriented prog.
