# language-syntax-collection

**My collection of syntax structures of programming languages I've known...**

**The programming languages available here are:** C, C++, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, HTML & Javascript

The purpose of this repository is to bring these langauges together and compare their syntaxes against many common subjects.

First of all, you can find "Hello, World!" output codes here. More different parts will come at a later date...
