# hello-github-2019
That's my first repository after a very long time. Wow! That's been more than two years since I created the initial repository which was also about saying hello-github!

Here, I'm now able to write more in this branch and after that, I'm ready to commit this change.
Anyway, I'm planning to create more repositories here, thus all of my projects in recent years will be organized and maintained here.
